The Entity-Environment Interaction Model

This model uses two basic constructs to build a game system: Environment and Entity.

Principles are simple:

Environment:
- Represents spaces and environments. A space can have physical rules or declare an environment that affects a player or entity directly.
- There is a Void Environment that has no rules affecting child entities.
- An environment cannot contain another environment, but it can combine characteristics from other environments.
- A basic tree looks like: App -> Scene -> Environment -> Entity
                                             +
                                      -> Environment -> Entity

Environments interact by combining their characteristics for their child entities, but entities from different environments cannot interact with each other.

Entity:
- An entity is always born inside an Environment.
- Represents interactive objects within the environment (characters, items, obstacles, etc.).
An entity can be given any variable or component that enables interaction with its parent environment.
- An entity can itself contain environments, enabling the creation of additional entities.
